## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run SWFT on your server using Docker.

### Installation

To install SWFT using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the SWFT repository:**

   Clone the SWFT repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hect1k/swft.git
   cd swft
   ```

2. **Copy the sample `.env` file:**

   Copy the `sample.env` file to create a `.env` file for configuration:

   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   ```

3. **Run the app using Docker Compose:**

   Start SWFT with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Configuration

Modify the `.env` file to suit your environment. At minimum, configure the following variables:

```bash
URL = "https://share.nnisarg.in" # URL of the hosted app
PORT = 8080 # Port of the hosted app
DB_HOST = "localhost" # Database host
DB_PORT = 5432 # Database port
DB_NAME = "swft" # Database name
DB_USER = "postgres" # Database user
DB_PASSWORD = "password" # Database password
ADMIN_USERNAME = "admin" # Username for the admin dashboard
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "swft" # Password for the admin dashboard
```

Additional settings can be configured as needed (e.g., email notifications, rate limits, analytics).

### Running the App

Once configured, run the app using Docker Compose as described above. The app will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
The admin dashboard can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/admin`. The default admin username is `admin` and password is `swft`.

## Usage

You can use SWFT to perform the following actions:

### Upload a File

1. Click "Select a file" to choose a file from your local storage.
2. Optionally, provide a custom link name.
3. Click "Share" to upload the file and get a shareable link.

### Share a File

Use the provided shareable link to access the uploaded file. You can also customize links for easier sharing.  
Additionally, there is an option to send the file to your email by providing your email address.

### Delete Files

Uploaded files are automatically deleted after the specified time, based on the configuration.

### Command-Line Usage (curl/wget)

SWFT supports sharing files using command-line tools like curl or wget. For example:

```bash
curl -F "file=@/path/to/file" -F "link=my-secret-file" -F "time=3" -F "email=email@example.com" http://localhost:8080/
```

This will give a shareable URL to the file like `http://localhost:8080/my-secret-file`, which will be deleted after the specified time.

The `email` and `link` parameters are optional. The `time` parameter should be provided in hours and should not exceed 168 hours (1 week).
